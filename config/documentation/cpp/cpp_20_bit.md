Bit manipulation (since C++20)
The header <bit> provides several function templates to access, manipulate, and process individual bits and bit sequences.

Defined in header <bit>
Defined in namespace std
bit_cast
  
(C++20)
 
reinterpret the object representation of one type as that of another
(function template)
byteswap
  
(C++23)
 
reverses the bytes in the given integer value
(function template)
has_single_bit
  
(C++20)
 
checks if a number is an integral power of two
(function template)
bit_ceil
  
(C++20)
 
finds the smallest integral power of two not less than the given value
(function template)
bit_floor
  
(C++20)
 
finds the largest integral power of two not greater than the given value
(function template)
bit_width
  
(C++20)
 
finds the smallest number of bits needed to represent the given value
(function template)
rotl
  
(C++20)
 
computes the result of bitwise left-rotation
(function template)
rotr
  
(C++20)
 
computes the result of bitwise right-rotation
(function template)
countl_zero
  
(C++20)
 
counts the number of consecutive 0 bits, starting from the most significant bit
(function template)
countl_one
  
(C++20)
 
counts the number of consecutive 1 bits, starting from the most significant bit
(function template)
countr_zero
  
(C++20)
 
counts the number of consecutive 0 bits, starting from the least significant bit
(function template)
countr_one
  
(C++20)
 
counts the number of consecutive 1 bits, starting from the least significant bit
(function template)
popcount
  
(C++20)
 
counts the number of 1 bits in an unsigned integer
(function template)
endian
  
(C++20)
 
indicates the endianness of scalar types
