## Environment
- **Qiskit Terra version**: 0.43.1 meta package, terra 0.24.1
- **Python version**: 3.10
- **Operating system**: docker continuumio/miniconda3

## What is happening?
When I declare a register named with the same name of a gate and then export it in QASM, the exporter generates invalid QASM where the register name clashes with the std gates (due to lack of escaping of the register name).

## How can we reproduce the issue?
Run this python script:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister
qr = QuantumRegister(2, name="q")
crz = ClassicalRegister(1, name="crz")
qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, crz)
qc.x(qr)
qc.measure(qr[0], crz[0])
qc.qasm(filename="my.qasm")

QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file("my.qasm").draw(output='mpl')
```
Produces this error:
```bash
qiskit.qasm.exceptions.QasmError: "Duplicate declaration for creg 'crz' at line 4, file my.qasm.\nPrevious occurrence at line 106, file /home/username/..../lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/qasm/libs/qelib1.inc"
```
The error happens only when importing the qasm file, whereas I believe the mistake is done by the exporter, which generates a file in which crz is defined both as standard gate (in qelib1.inc) and as register (via my code).

This is the genrated QASM:
```qasm
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[2];
creg crz[1];
x q[0];
x q[1];
measure q[0] -> crz[0];
```

## What should happen?
I would have expected the QASM exporter to generate a valid qasm, ready to be reimported.

## Any suggestions?
I would suggest to improve the exporter by escaping any register name to avoid clashes with standard libraries.
