# SMT Solver

## Oracle

The oracle is through differential testing. We follow the classic work of "On the Unusual Effectiveness of Type-Aware Operator
Mutations for Testing SMT Solvers"

Our differential testing setup is through Z3 and CvC5
- crash bugs: Formula 洧램 triggers a soundness bug if solvers 洧녡1 and 洧녡2 both do not crash
and give different satisfiabilities for 洧램.
- invalid model bugs: Formula 洧램 triggers an invalid model bug if the model returned by the
solver does not satisfy 洧램.
- soundness bugs: Formula 洧램 triggers a crash bug if the solver throws out an assertion violation or a
segmentation fault while solving 洧램.
